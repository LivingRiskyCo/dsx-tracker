# Opponent-of-Opponent Tracking - Complete Dataset Builder

## üìù **How to Add These Teams**

### **Option 1: Check Existing Divisions**

Some of these teams may already be in tracked divisions:

**Check:**
- `OCL_BU08_Stripes_Division_Rankings.csv` - Main OCL division
- `OCL_BU08_White_Division_Rankings.csv` - Club Ohio West division
- `CPL_Fall_2025_Division_Rankings.csv` - CPL divisions

**Script:**
```python
# Quick check
import pandas as pd

divisions = pd.read_csv('OCL_BU08_Stripes_Division_Rankings.csv')
teams_to_add = pd.read_csv('Teams_to_Track_Clean.csv')

for team in teams_to_add['Team']:
    if team in divisions['Team'].values:
        print(f"‚úÖ {team} - Already tracked")
    else:
        print(f"‚ùå {team} - Need to add")
```

### **Option 2: Find Their Division**

For teams not found:

1. **Check GotSport:**
   - Visit https://system.gotsport.com/org_event/events/45535/results
   - Search for team name
   - Find their division/group ID

2. **Create New Fetch Script:**
   - If they're in a new division, create `fetch_[division_name].py`
   - Add to `update_all_data.py`
   - Add division file to `load_division_data()` in `dsx_dashboard.py`

### **Option 3: Manual Addition**

If teams aren't in tracked divisions:

1. **Get Their Stats:**
   - Manually fetch from GotSport or division site
   - Add to a new CSV file (e.g., `Additional_Teams_Rankings.csv`)

2. **Add to Dashboard:**
   - Add CSV file to `load_division_data()` function
   - Team will appear in all rankings and comparisons

---

## üîç **Teams We Couldn't Find**

### **No GotSport Data:**
- **Ohio Premier 2017 Boys Premier OCL** - 2017 boys (U9), not in tracked divisions
- **Ohio Premier 2017 Boys Academy Dublin White** - 2017 boys (U9), not in tracked divisions
- **Columbus United Columbus United U8B** - Unknown division/league
- **BSA Celtic 18B United** - In MVYSA (different system)
- **BSA Celtic 18B City** - In MVYSA (different system)

**Note:** BSA Celtic teams are tracked via `fetch_bsa_celtic.py` (MVYSA system).

## üìä **Files Created**

### **1. Opponents_of_Opponents.csv**
**Purpose:** Mapping of which DSX opponent played which other team

**Format:**
```
DSX_Opponent,Opponent_of_Opponent
Blast FC Soccer Academy Blast FC 2018B,Club Ohio Club Ohio West 18B Academy II
Elite FC Elite FC 2018 Boys Liverpool,Northwest FC Northwest FC 2018B Academy Blue
...
```

### **2. Opponent_Schedules.csv**
**Purpose:** All matches found from opponents' schedules

**Format:**
```
Date,Opponent,Team,Score
2025-09-15,Club Ohio Club Ohio West 18B Academy II,Blast FC Soccer Academy Blast FC 2018B,4-2
...
```

### **3. Teams_to_Track.csv**
**Purpose:** Complete list of all teams to add to tracking

**Format:**
```
Team,Source,Date_Added
Club Oranje Club Oranje Raptors 2018 BU08 Navy,Opponent of Opponent,2025-10-31
Dublin United Soccer Club DUSC Sharks 2018 Boys,Opponent of Opponent,2025-10-31
...
```

### **4. Teams_to_Track_Clean.csv**
**Purpose:** Filtered list (removed scores, invalid entries)

---

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. ‚úÖ Review `Teams_to_Track_Clean.csv`
2. ‚úÖ Check if teams are already in tracked divisions
3. ‚úÖ For missing teams, find their division on GotSport
4. ‚úÖ Create fetch scripts for new divisions (if needed)
5. ‚úÖ Add to `update_all_data.py` workflow

### **Integration:**
1. **Add to Dashboard:**
   ```python
   # In dsx_dashboard.py, add new division files to load_division_data()
   division_files = [
       # ... existing files ...
       "Additional_Teams_Rankings.csv",  # If manually added
   ]
   ```

2. **Add to Update Workflow:**
   ```python
   # In update_all_data.py
   updates.append(run_script(
       "fetch_[new_division].py",
       "New Division Description"
   ))
   ```

## üí° **Benefits of This Approach**

### **1. Complete Dataset**
- Track **all teams** that DSX's opponents have played
- Build comprehensive strength index comparisons
- Identify common opponents for better predictions

### **2. Better Predictions**
- More data points for strength calculations
- Cross-reference opponent performance vs. common teams
- Identify trends and patterns

### **3. Opponent Intelligence**
- See who each opponent has played
- Compare DSX's performance vs. same opponents
- Build "common opponent" analysis

---

## üîÑ **Keeping It Updated**

### **Run Periodically:**
```bash
python fetch_opponent_opponents.py
```

**Recommended:** Once per week (after weekend games)

**When to Run:**
- After major tournaments
- When new opponents appear in DSX schedule
- Monthly for ongoing league updates

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**

### **1. Scraping Success Rate**
- **9 of 14 opponents** successfully scraped (64%)
- Some teams not in GotSport (MVYSA, other systems)
- Some 2017 boys teams not in tracked divisions

### **2. Data Quality**
- Some match data may be incomplete
- Score parsing may miss some details
- Team name variations need fuzzy matching

### **3. Ongoing Maintenance**
- Need to check for new teams periodically
- Division URLs may change
- Team IDs may change

---

## üìà **Impact on Data Completeness**

### **Before:**
- **14 DSX opponents** tracked
- Limited cross-reference data

### **After:**
- **14 DSX opponents** tracked
- **44 teams** from opponents' opponents
- **148 matches** of additional data
- Much richer dataset for comparisons

---

## üéØ **Conclusion**

Tracking opponents' opponents significantly expands your dataset:

- ‚úÖ **More teams** = More comparisons
- ‚úÖ **More matches** = Better strength calculations
- ‚úÖ **Common opponents** = Better predictions

**Next Action:** Review `Teams_to_Track_Clean.csv` and integrate new teams into your tracking system.
